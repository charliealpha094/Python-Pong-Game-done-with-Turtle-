# Python-Pong-Game-done-with-Turtle-
Simple and classic Pong game made with Python and Turtle graphics. 
This is the first game that I've ever developed!
Even though I wouldn't use Turtle graphics to build a more serious/professional project game, this was a great way to give me some insights about how to manage a 2D game application.
